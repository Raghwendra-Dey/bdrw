## Relevant files
1. Head over to the [`ps.txt`](https://github.com/Raghwendra-Dey/bdrw/blob/master/ps.txt) to read the problem statement.<br>
2. [`with_early_stopping.ipynb`](https://github.com/Raghwendra-Dey/bdrw/blob/master/with_early_stopping.ipynb) is the final file submitted by me.<br>
3. [`without_early_stopping.ipynb`](https://github.com/Raghwendra-Dey/bdrw/blob/master/without_early_stopping.ipynb) doesn't uses early stopping and trains for a fixed number of epochs.<br><br>

Got a <b>*9/10*</b> score for this project.<br>
This model with early stopping achieved a <b>*95.71%* test accuracy</b> and <b>*98.58%* train accuracy</b>.<br><br>
This is the part of the final project for the course DLFA(Deep Learning Foundations and Applications) by prof. Debdoot sheet offered by Centre of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence, IIT Kharagpur.<br><br>
NOTE: This project was done in the kaggle notebooks so all the file paths for loading the dataset, saving model, etc are according to the ones used in kaggle. You can find the kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/raghwendradey/dlfa-proj-1).
