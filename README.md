# bdrw
DL based solution for the BDRW(Bengali Digit Recognition in the Wild) [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/debdoot/bdrw) in kaggle.<br>
This is the part of the final project for the course DLFA(Deep Learning Foundations and Applications) in IIT Kharagpur.<br>
Head over to the [`ps.txt`](https://github.com/Raghwendra-Dey/bdrw/blob/master/ps.txt) to read the problem statement and [`with_early_stopping.ipynb`](https://github.com/Raghwendra-Dey/bdrw/blob/master/with_early_stopping.ipynb) is the final file submitted by me.<br>
NOTE: This project was done in the kaggle notebooks so all the file paths for loading the dataset, saving model, etc are according to the ones used in kaggle. You can find the kaggle notebook [here](https://www.kaggle.com/raghwendradey/dlfa-proj-1).
